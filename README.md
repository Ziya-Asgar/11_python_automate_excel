## Notes

This is a session to practice controlling Excel files with Python. The session contains:

- importing specific parts of the `openpyxl` module,
- loading an Excel workbook with the `load_workbook` function,
- accessing the active sheet in the file with `<workbook>.active`,
- reading and writing to a workbook by accessing specific cells,
- writing to a workbook using the `<worksheet>.append` method,
- saving the workbook,
- retrieving all the sheet names,
- accessing a specific sheet, instead of an active sheet,
- creating a new sheet,
- creating a new workbook,
- giving a name to the active sheet,
- accessing specific columns in a sheet with the help of the `get_column_letter` function,
- merging and unmerging cells,
- insert and deleting rows and columns,
- cutting and pasting cells,
- controlling the styling in a sheet,
- finally, taking data from a python dictionary and writing them to a new Excel file.

Here is the [OpenPyXl documentation](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to get more information about various methods of working with an Excel file using Python.

The session could be coded along following this link, although my code and file is a bit different:
